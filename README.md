## Details
**Created by: [Rosvaldas Šlekys](https://github.com/RosSlek) and [Martynas Višnevskis](https://github.com/Samsungelis)**

This is the final project in Vilnius Coding School 

Project theme: "Traffic intensity, road conditions and road accident analysis"

## The main goals of the work are several:

1. Gather the date related to traffic conditions, road accidents through channels such as: 
- websites (using the JSON method)
- complete CSV files

2. Put in good order extracted data using Pandas library;
3. Create charts using matplotlib library;
4. Analyze the data through charts to see tendencies and not only raw data.
5. Use knowledge gained during the lessons to implement menu functionality, so that a user could choose the options to execute from the provided list.
6. Finally, using auto-py-to-exe application apply command window for easier execution of the program.


## Main_analysis_file.py

Used libraries: Pandas, MatplotLib, requests, os.path

Steps: 

1. Creating scraping functions from each channel. The fuctions contains and is not limited to:
- JSON method
- Pandas library to set the DataFrames and sort/filter/clear the data which is then appears into the newly made CSV format documents.
2. Using mathematical functions: mean, round. Also, applying the functions in the favor of user, so he could select the period from which he wants to extract the data with its average values.
3. Writing functions to create charts using matplotlib library.
4. Creating menu functionality.


## Main_analysis_file.exe

Steps:

1. Using Terminal window installing the application auto-py-to-exe:
2. Testing the result for the final usage.
