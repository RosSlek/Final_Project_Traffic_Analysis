## Details
**Created by: [Rosvaldas Šlekys](https://github.com/RosSlek) and [Martynas Višnevskis](https://github.com/Samsungelis)**

This is the final project in Vilnius Coding School. 

Project theme: "Traffic intensity, road conditions and road accident analysis"

## The main goals for this project were to:
#### •	Get and analyze data of driving conditions in Lithuania.
#### •	Get and analyze data about traffic intensity in Lithuania.
#### •	Get and analyze data about road accidents.

## Main tools used to reach the goal:
Pandas, MatplotLib, Requests, BeautifulSoup, Time, Schedule.

## Main steps taken to  get data:
#### •	Function to scrape free proxy list.
#### •	Function to scrape JSON format page to get real time data about driving conditions, traffic intensity put information to DataFrames.
#### •	Function to scrape real time data periodically and save it to CSV.
#### •	Functions to scrape data about road accidents.
## Main steps taken to analyse data:
#### •	Cleaning data from unnecessary information, checking for errors and removing them.
#### •	Putting data to DataFrames, reshaping it, grouping and adjusting so it would be easier to understand.
#### •	Calculating averages, comparing data of different countries.
#### •	Creating new CSV`s so it would be better to see, export data and less scrapping would be used.
#### •	Creating visuals like graphs to see tendencies and more pleasing view of data.
## Conslusion
We reached the goal of analysing data about road conditions and road accidents by creating a lot of functions for different purposes and made a meniu, so it would be easier to navigate and get only the needed information. We also have ability to refresh data on demand, easily access it as CSV format files and created a small application so this script could be accessible on other computers.
